# Hello World!!!
My first repository and a short message to the future

To dreaming dreams I have long dreamt!!!

I am really excited to do something that I am passionate about!!! I have almost a year left in the Army and I am taking my first steps at working towards my goal to becoming a junior web developer. I have been researching coding boot camps at course report and decided that if I were to enroll in a coding boot camp, I would choose Coding Dojo. I have been reading two blogs: acodingodyssey and nodfs. I am excited about coding and I am ready to jump in and start my first project!!!

To the future me, "Hello Glenn!!! I hope you are having a great life coding!!!"
